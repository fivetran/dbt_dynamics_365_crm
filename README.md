## What does this dbt package do?

This package models Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/microsoft-dynamics/dynamics365crm). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/microsoft-dynamics/dynamics365crm#schemainformation).

The main focus of the package is to enhance the Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM data by adding human-readable labels for fields (created as `<field_name>_label`) that store coded values (e.g., integer codes or option sets). This package integrates stringmaps into the source tables, translating codes into meaningful labels.

<!--section="dynamics_365_crm_transformation_model"-->
The following table provides a detailed list of all models materialized within this package by default.
> TIP: See more details about these tables in the package's [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_dynamics_365_crm/#!/overview).

### Materialized Models
Each Quickstart transformation job run materializes 7 models if all components of this data model are enabled. This count includes all staging, intermediate, and final models materialized as `view`, `table`, or `incremental`.

## How do I use the dbt package?

### Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:

- At least one Fivetran Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM connection syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **Databricks**, or **PostgreSQL** destination.

#### Databricks dispatch configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package, you must add the following (or a variation of the following) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

### Step 2: Install the package
Include the following Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM package version in your `packages.yml` file:
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/dynamics_365_crm
    version: 0.1.0-b1
```

### Step 3: Define database and schema variables

By default, this package runs using your destination and the `dynamics_365` schema. If this is not where your Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM data is (for example, if your Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM schema is named `dynamics_365_crm_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
  dynamics_365_crm_database: your_database_name
  dynamics_365_crm_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### Step 4: Enable/Disable Variables
By default, this package brings in data from the Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM source tables listed in [`models/src_dynamics_365_crm.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_dynamics_365_crm/blob/main/models/src_dynamics_365_crm.yml). However, if you have disabled syncing any of these sources, you will need to add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml`:

```yml
vars:
    dynamics_365_crm_using_<default_source_table_name>: false # default = true
```

### (Optional) Step 5: Additional configurations
<details open><summary>Expand/Collapse details</summary>

#### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_dynamics_365_crm`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM data to be written, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
  dynamics_365_crm:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

#### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:

```yml
vars:
    dynamics_365_crm_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
</details>

### (Optional) Step 6: Orchestrate your models with Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™
